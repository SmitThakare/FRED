# Economic Indicators Analysis Using FRED API

## Overview
This project uses the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) API to compare and analyze various economic indicators. The main focus is to explore correlations between these indicators and derive insights into the economy.

## Indicators Used
The following economic indicators are analyzed in this project, along with their corresponding FRED API codes:

- **Unemployment Rate:** `UNRATE`
- **Nonfarm Payrolls:** `PAYEMS`
- **Real GDP:** `GDPC1`
- **GDP Growth Rate:** `A191RL1Q225SBEA`
- **CPI All Items:** `CPIAUCSL`
- **Core CPI:** `CPILFESL`
- **PPI All Commodities:** `PPIACO`
- **PPI Core:** `PPIACO`
- **Industrial Production:** `INDPRO`
- **Retail Sales Total:** `RSAFS`
- **Housing Starts:** `HOUST`
- **Existing Home Sales:** `EXHOSLUSM495S`
- **Federal Funds Rate:** `FEDFUNDS`
- **Money Supply M1:** `M1`
- **Money Supply M2:** `M2`
- **S&P 500 Index:** `SP500`
- **10-Year Treasury Yield:** `GS10`
- **Trade Balance:** `NETEXC`
- **Exchange Rate Indexes:** `DTWEXM`
- **Federal Budget Balance:** `FYFSD`
- **Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio:** `GFDEGDQ188S`

## Project Structure

- **FRED.py**: This is the main script that handles data retrieval from the FRED API and performs correlation analysis between the selected economic indicators. The script outputs a correlation matrix and visualizations to help understand the relationships between the indicators.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `pandas`
- `requests`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `numpy`

You can install them using pip:

```sh
pip install pandas requests matplotlib seaborn numpy
```

You will also need a FRED API key. If you don't have one, you can obtain it by registering at [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/).

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add your FRED API key:

   ```sh
   FRED_API_KEY=your_fred_api_key
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Script:**
   Execute the `FRED.py` script to retrieve data and perform correlation analysis:

   ```sh
   python FRED.py
   ```

   This script will fetch data for all the specified indicators, calculate correlations, and generate visualizations.

## Outputs

- **Correlation Matrix:** A table showing the correlation coefficients between each pair of indicators.
- **Visualizations:** Plots that help visualize the correlations and trends among the indicators.

## Conclusion

This project offers a basic framework for analyzing economic indicators using the FRED API. By examining the correlations between different indicators, you can gain insights into the relationships that influence economic conditions. This analysis can be expanded by adding more indicators or applying advanced statistical techniques.
